# Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuning for Auxiliary Cardiovascular Data

## by: Emma Chi, Ben Brill, Cecile Wu

In this project, we explored the tuning parameters of random forest with the goal of finding the most important of these parameters for cross validation accuracy. Using an auxiliary cardiovascular disease dataset, we created and compared a fractional factorial design and an optimal design. We then determined signficant parameters through half normal plots, then modified our model and evaluated it through residual analyses.
